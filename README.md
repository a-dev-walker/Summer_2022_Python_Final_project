# Summer_2022_Python_Final_project

Final project for Adam Walker, Charlotte Blewitt, Luke Teitell, and Max La Forest.


For our final project we recreated the classic board game, Connect 4, in which players try to win by placing colored pieces into a grid in an attempt to make a line of four pieces of their color. 


We recommend running this code on VS code or another local IDE rather than on google colab.

Pre-requisites: pygame, pygame-menu, numpy, os 

To run please download the entire repository to account for the assets. Run the main-game.py file and enjoy a lively game of connect four.


Participation:
We all developed a minimum viable product for this game and then broke off into specialities to finish the project.


Adam Walker: Main game and graphics development 
Luke Teitell: Main menu and menu integration 
Charlotte Blewitt: Presentation creation and in class presenting
Max La Forest: Presentation creation and in class presenting
